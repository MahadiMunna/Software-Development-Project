# Software-Development-Project with Django

This is all I have got from my course Phitron. This was the last semester of Phitron. I've learned everything with my best. Thanks to all my course teachers, specially Md Abdullah All Naim bhai was a great teacher behind my learning django and warmest thanks to Avishek Devnath bhai for a proper guidence to end this. Also thanks to Phitron team. It was a great journey!
